From a technical standpoint, each game is:

  - a directed graph with nodes (aka stations) and edges (permitted
  paths between stations); these nodes and edges can change during
  gameplay

  - trigger events that occur when a player (or a number of players or
  a specific player or a player with a specific inventory item)
  reaches a node or edge

  - timed events that occur at specific (or random times)

The coding language for the game is currently undecided.
